## Setup
-------
1. Bring up the sample app with Android studio
2. Create a new Android application in MAAS-portal
3. In strings.xml (under Sample/src/main/res/values) of the downloaded sample, replace the appId, accessKey and signatureKey with values for this application in MAAS portal.

  e.g.Replace the following strings with values from MaaS Portal

  `<string name="appId">1421</string>`

  `<string name="accesKey">b91b116ceafb413bed252a7b274e95a622aee20b</string>`

  `<string name="sigKey">3191eacc0cd0a5f66b445d11fbdf08fad7c596b8</string>`

  Because we also show a google map in the sample app, in order to use the locations feature please also add the following meta data tag with a google maps key

  `<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY" android:value="XXXX"/>`

4. Set up GCM at https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/client
5. Create a project on Firebase console

    -> Choose 'Add Firebase to Android app'

    -> In the Firebase console, the package name should be the same as application id in build.grade (under Sample directory) in the sample app. The default application id in the engagement sample app is com.phunware.engagement.sample
6. In the MAAS portal, for the newly created Android app, replace the API Key and sender id with the values for ServerKey and SenderId on the Firebase console (under CloudMessaging section)
7. The Firebase console creates a google-services.json file and downloads it to your default Downloads folder.
8. Replace the default google-service.json file (under Sample directory) the sample app with the dowloaded google-service.json from Firebase console
9. Add the google-services gradle plugin to you applications gradle file
  `apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'`
10. Compile the project under Android Studio and run it on the device
